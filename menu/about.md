title: About

For the past four years I have worked as a researcher at [CENTRA/SIM](https://centra.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). The focus of my work was the development of data mining/machine learning software tools for analysis of the large datasets from the Gaia mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). Prior to this I was a PhD researcher, modelling the spiral arms of our own Galaxy as traced by runaway stars (featured in [New Scientist magazine](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729044.000-runaway-stars-to-fill-in-the-blanks-in-milky-way-map/)).
